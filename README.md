Year 2 Sem 2 Infomation System project

# IMPORTANT
This is for everyone using github. Due to the complexity of git, I decided to use only one branch but a problem will occur by doing this.

To prevent this problem I advise everyone to **pull** this repo before using Visual Studio. And please **push** it up to the network before close the solution or exit Visual Studio.

> 1. open Visual Studio
> 2. pull
> 3. do assignment or make changes
> 4. push
